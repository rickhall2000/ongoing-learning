# What do I want this to do?

# This is going to be two phases - build data, then look at the data

# I want to take a list of starting pages
# This could be an opportunity to use dask, maybe? pull different things in parallel?

# I want to pull from a URL and then parse the data
    # what I want from the page is the list of characters
    # for each episode I want to store the name of the episode and each of the characters' names
    # i want to store this in a graph database

# I want to navigate to the next page and repeat
